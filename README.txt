Prompter is intended for driving a teleprompter / autocue.

It simply reads a text file, displays it in high contrast (white on black)
text, but in a mirror image form, so that it can be read normally when viewed
in the teleprompter's mirror. Scrolling is achieved simply by using a mouse wwith scroll-wheel. Smooth scrolling is enabled for the text area.
